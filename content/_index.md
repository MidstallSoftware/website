## Our Mission

We're a group of passionate developers that want to see more competition in the tech ecosystem marketplace.
By using open source technologies such as Linux, Flutter, and RISC-V; we're aiming to build our own operating system, cloud services, and hardware.

## Our History

Founded in 2020 by Tristan Ross, we began as a small group of passionate people.
Over the past nearly four years, we've been working on researching and developing [ExpidusOS](https://expidusos.com).
