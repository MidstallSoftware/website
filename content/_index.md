## We Build SDKs Developers Love to Use

Helping companies deliver cross-platform, reliable SDKs—powered by expert experience in LLVM, nixpkgs, Zig, and embedded systems.

## What We Do

- SDK Design & Architecture (embedded, API, multi-language)
- Cross-Compilation Toolchains (LLVM, Nix, Zig)
- Packaging, CI/CD, & Reproducible Builds
- BSP packaging & device porting
- Docs & Developer Experience Optimization

## Why Midstall Software?

### 1. SDKs That “Just Work”

Using Nix-powered reproducible builds, we eliminate environment inconsistencies—no more “but it built fine on my machine” chaos.

### 2. Safe, Predictable Releases

Nix ensures sandboxed builds, atomic changes, and effortless rollbacks—your SDK won’t break your clients’ workflows.

### 3. Cross-Platform by Design

With deep roots in LLVM and nixpkgs, we build SDKs that integrate seamlessly across embedded systems, cloud, and developer stacks.

### 4. Developer-First Experience

We eliminate documentation debt by delivering accurate guides, real-world samples, and intuitive APIs that developers actually enjoy using.

*“Outdated or missing docs” are a leading cause of integration delays.*

## Our Mission

Our mission is to spread open source and create a diverse open source ecosystem.
