A project we will be launching in the future with the goal to design and sell custom ARM or RISC-V hardware.
We're planning on starting with small form factor computers and work towards other form factors.

## Planned Features

- Easy repairs of all components
- Fully open source for design, firmware, manuals, etc.
- Comparable performance to other modern devices
- User upgradable

Launch date: *TBA*
